# utilities
day to day utilities for data engineers

my_sftp.py depends on config file SFTP_Config.ini
--> After the configuration parameters are set, run the python script for fetching from and uploading files to ftp servers

log_archive.py
--> a handy code file with content that can be put in scripts to create logging. It zips old dated logs, and creates 
new zip after it hits 200MB size.

requests_example.py
--> simple google request to get the location information.
